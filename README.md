# Cooking For Blockheads Connector

This is a Minecraft client mod for Forge that adds a new [Cooking For Blockheads](https://github.com/blay09/CookingForBlockheads) floor block able to connect inventories placed above it.

The mod ic currently been tested with Minecraft 1.12.
Avoid connecting several times the same inventory (like placing two connectors under a double chest), this will create count errors when crafting and may result in items being lost (if not enough are present).
